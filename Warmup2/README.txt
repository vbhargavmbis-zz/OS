Steps to compile:
(Once all files have been extracted and placed in one folder)
1. type "make" and press enter. This will compile the source codes and create an executable called "warmup2"
2. to execute: type "warmup2 [-n num] [-lambda lambda] [-mu mu] [-r r] [-B B] [-P P] [-t tsfile]" and press 
            enter, where tsfile is the name of the tracefile and all arguments in "[]" are optional.

I have not made any design decisions or deviations from the specs.
